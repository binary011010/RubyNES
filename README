*Note*: At the moment this emulator is hard-set to only work with Mapper #0 (aka No Mapper) games. I'm going to continue focus my work on getting these games working until I have the emulator stable, then I'll try to increase compatibility to others. As such, I'll keep a list of known Mapper #0 games here for anyone wishing to test: 
Mario Bros.
Super Mario Bros. (standalone version, not the version bundled with Duck Hunt)
Donkey Kong
ExciteBike
Burger Time

*Note*: The debugger doesn't seem to want to receive input while running under Cygwin. This should hopefully be easy to fix. 

*Note*: Here's a little performance tuning for jruby: 
jruby --fast -J-Xmn512m -J-Xms1024m -J-Xmx1024m -J-server
